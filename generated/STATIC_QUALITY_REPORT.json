        "The `taskkill` selection is overly generic (`/f /im`), as force-killing processes by image name is a very common administrative and automated task, leading to a high volume of false positives.",
        "The filter for legitimate parent processes is minimal and can be easily bypassed by an attacker running the commands from a standard `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe` prompt.",

        "Modify the `condition` to be `(1 of selection) and target_keywords and not filter_legitimate`. This will correctly focus the detection on the intended targets.",

      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "The `filter_legitimate` condition (`CommandLine|contains: 'list shadows'`) is redundant. The selection logic already requires the `delete` keyword, so a command like `vssadmin list shadows` would never trigger the rule in the first place. This indicates a minor logic flaw.",
        "The 'false_positive' test scenario is poorly chosen, as the example command (`vssadmin.exe list shadows`) would not be detected by the rule's selection criteria, and therefore isn't a true false positive that the filter prevents.",
        "The rule is limited to specific command-line utilities and does not cover equivalent PowerShell cmdlets (e.g., `Remove-ComputerRestorePoint`) or direct WMI/API calls, as correctly noted in the 'false_negative' scenario."
