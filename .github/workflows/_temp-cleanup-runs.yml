# Temporary Workflow - Bulk Delete Workflow Runs
#
# This workflow uses a marketplace action to delete all old workflow runs.
# To use:
#   1. Rename file: _temp-cleanup-runs.yml → temp-cleanup-runs.yml
#   2. Run: gh workflow run temp-cleanup-runs.yml
#   3. Wait for completion
#   4. Rename back: temp-cleanup-runs.yml → _temp-cleanup-runs.yml
#
# The underscore prefix prevents GitHub from recognizing this as an active workflow.
